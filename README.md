Wikipedia has a lot of interesting [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spaceflight_launches_in_January%E2%80%93June_2022) about rocket launches, but it's hard to
parse and read the wikipedia table format. This library converts the wikipedia
launch tables to JSON for easy consumption.

`data/` contains the cleaned JSON data, organized by decade

## Usage

```sh
# Build
go build .

# Create a local cache
launchdata cache all --output-dir ./data

# Explore
launchdata browse 2022
```
